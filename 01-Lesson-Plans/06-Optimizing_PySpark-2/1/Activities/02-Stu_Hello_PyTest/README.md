#  Hello PyTest

In this activity, you'll write a test suite to use against two functions that pass, one that returns the length of a string multiplied by 5, and one that removes the letter "e" from a string.

### Instructions

1. Using the starter code provided in test_functions.py, write a function that tests whether function_one()  returns a value of 25 when the string is "hello.".
     * After youâ€™ve finished, take a moment to think about why 25 is the expected value for `function_one("hello")`.

2. Using the starter code provided, write a function that tests whether or not `function_two()` will remove the letter "e" from the string "hello".
    * **Hint:** The `assert` statement for the test function against `function_two()` should equal the string "hllo."

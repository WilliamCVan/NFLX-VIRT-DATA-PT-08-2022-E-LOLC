# Designing an ERD, Part 1

In this activity, you’ll work with a partner to first create a conceptual ERD and then update it to a logical ERD.

## Background

You and your partner are meeting with a gym owner who wants to organize the gym data in a database. This will require creating a conceptual ERD for the owner and then a logical ERD, which you’ll use in a later activity.

## Instructions

1. Use [QuickDBD](https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/) to create a conceptual ERD by entering the entities along with their attributes that will exist in the database. Be sure to include `trainers`, `members`, `gym`, and one more entity that you think is necessary.

2. When you feel satisfied with the conceptual ERD, update it to a logical ERD by adding the column data types and primary keys.

## Hint

For explanations of ERDs that are more in-depth, read [Conceptual, Logical and Physical Data Model](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/support/documents/vpuserguide/3563/3564/85378_conceptual,l.html).

# Data Relationships

In this activity, you’ll design a database model.

## Background

You’re the database consultant at a new university. Your job is to design a database model for the registrar. The database will keep track of information about students, about the courses that the university offers, and about the courses that each student has taken. 

## Instructions

1. Create a `students` table that keeps track of the following:

    * The unique ID number of each student

    * The last and the first name of each student

2. Create a `courses` table that keeps track of the following:

    * The unique ID number of each course

    * The name of each course

3. Create a `student_courses_junction` table that keeps track of the following:

    * All the courses that each student has taken

    * The term (spring or fall) during which each student took each course 

4. Answer the following question: Which data model is appropriate for this database&mdash;one to one, one to many, or many to many?

## Bonus

If time allows, research how to use `JOIN` statements to query the tables to get all the data about the students.

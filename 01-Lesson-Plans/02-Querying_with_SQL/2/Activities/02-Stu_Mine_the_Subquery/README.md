# Mine the Subqueries

In this activity, youâ€™ll continue to practice writing subqueries. You can work either individually or with a partner. For help with the queries, you can use the ERD at the link for this [PostgreSQL Sample Database](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/).

**Note:** This activity will use the previously created `rental_db` database.

## Instructions

1. Using subqueries, identify all the actors in the `pagila` database who appear in the film ALTER VICTORY.

2. Using subqueries, display the titles of the films that the employee Jon Stephens rented to customers.

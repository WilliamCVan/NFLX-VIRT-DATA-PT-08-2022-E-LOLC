# Unions

In this activity, youâ€™ll practice creating unions by combining data from tables without using joins. 

**Note:** This activity will use the previously created `rental_db` database.

## Instructions

1. Using `UNION`, write a PostgreSQL statement to query the number of rows in the `city` and `country` tables.

2. Using `UNION`, display the ID numbers of all the customers in the `customer` and `customer_list` tables who live in the city of London. Determine whether both tables contain the same customers by using `UNION ALL`.

    **Hint:** Consider using subqueries.

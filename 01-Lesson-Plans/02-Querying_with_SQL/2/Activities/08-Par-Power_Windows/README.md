# Power Windows

In this activity, youâ€™ll work with a partner to practice writing queries that use window functions.

## Instructions

1. Write a query to get a running total of the selling prices of the items in the Baby Products category.

2. Write a query that ranks the products from the most to the least expensive.

3. Modify the previous query to rank the products by category from the most to the least expensive.

## Bonus

Write a query that counts the number of times that each shipping method was used and ranks the counts for each category.

* **Hint:** You need to use `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` in the `RANK` window function.

* The results should appear as follows: 

  | | category<br>character varying (40) | shipping_method<br>character varying (10) | count<br>bigint | rank<br>bigint |
  |----|----|----|----| ---|

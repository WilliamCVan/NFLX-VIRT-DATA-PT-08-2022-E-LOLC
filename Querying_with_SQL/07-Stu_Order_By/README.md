# Ordering Movie Data

In this activity, you’ll combine `ORDER BY` with other SQL keywords to query and order the tables.

## Instructions

1. Display the count of actor first names and the names themselves in descending order.

2. Display the average rental duration in ascending order rounded to two decimal places for each rating, and group the results by the rating.

3. Display the 10 most-expensive average replacement costs for movies, with the movies in descending order by their length.

    * **Hint:** You can limit the data returned to a certain number of rows by using the `LIMIT` clause. To learn how to use it, see this [PostgreSQL LIMIT tutorial](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-limit/).

## Bonus

Using the `payment` and `customer` tables, display the total that each customer paid, with the totals in descending order.

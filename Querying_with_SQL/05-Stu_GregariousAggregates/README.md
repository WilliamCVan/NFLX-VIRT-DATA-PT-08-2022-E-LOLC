# Aggregating Movie Data

In this activity, you’ll practice writing queries that use aggregate functions, grouping, and aliases.

## Instructions

Use aggregate functions as you run queries to answer the following questions:

* What’s the average cost to rent a film in the stores?

* What’s the average rental cost of the films for each rating? On average, which rating corresponds to the least expensive film to rent? Which corresponds to the most expensive?

* How much would it cost to replace all the films in the database?

* How much would it cost to replace all the films in each rating category?

* How long is the longest movie in the database? How short is the shortest movie?

## Hints

* For a summary of the available functions, see the Postgres documentation on [aggregate functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html).

* Try using aliases for more-informative column headings.

### Instructions

Keep the following mind while working on the assessment: 

* Remember that this is an individual assessment&mdash;you may not work with your classmates. However, you are free to consult your course notes and activities to help you answer the questions. 

* Although this assessment is delivered in a Jupyter Notebook, you will have to create databases and tables from the datasets in the Resources folder to solve the questions. You do NOT need to submit the datasets as part of the assessment; only submit the notebook containing your answers. 

    > **Note:** If your answers are not clearly identified, you may receive a score of “0” for that question. 

* We recommend you make a copy of the `Unit_1_Assessment_unsolved.ipynb` file to use as you work through each question. After you complete a question, transfer your answer to the `Unit_1_Assessment_unsolved.ipynb` file that you will submit. 

* When you are ready to submit your assessment, rename the `Unit_1_Assessment_unsolved.ipynb` file with your last name. For example, `Unit_1_Assessment_lastname.ipynb`.

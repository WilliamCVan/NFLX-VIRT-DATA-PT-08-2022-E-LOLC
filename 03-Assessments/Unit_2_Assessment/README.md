## Instructions

Keep the following mind while working on the assessment: 

* Remember that this is an individual assessment&mdash;you may not work with your classmates. However, you are free to consult your course notes and activities to help you answer the questions. 

* Although this assessment is delivered in a Jupyter Notebook, we recommend that make a copy of the `Unit_2_Assessment_unsolved.ipynb` file and upload into Google Colab. 

    > **Note:** If your answers are not clearly identified, you may receive a score of “0” for that question. 

* When you are ready to submit your assessment, rename the Google Colab notebook file with your last name. For example, `Unit_2_Assessment_<your_last_name>.ipynb`. Please do not clear your outputs if you have written code.
